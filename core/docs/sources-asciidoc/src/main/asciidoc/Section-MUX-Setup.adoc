[[_mux_preinstall_requirements_and_prerequisites]]
== Pre-Install Requirements and Prerequisites

Ensure that the following requirements have been met before continuing with the installation process.

[[_mux_hardware_requirements]]
=== Hardware Requirements

MUX does not have any hardware requirements.

[[_mux_software_prerequisites]]
=== Software Prerequisites

MUX must be deployed either in {jee-version} v4.x or v5.x.
However it is possible to adapt configuration files and run in any JMX container.

[[_mux_source_code]]
== Source Code

This section provides instructions on how to obtain and build the {this-platform} Diameter MUX from source code.

[[_mux_release_source_building]]
=== Release Source Code Building


. Downloading the source code
+
IMPORTANT: Subversion is used to manage its source code.
Instructions for using Subversion, including installation, can be found at http://svnbook.red-bean.com.
+
Use SVN to checkout a specific release source.
The base URL is {this-trunk-source-code-url} .
Then add the specific release version, for example {project-version} .
+
[source]
----
[usr]$ git clone git@github.com:RestComm/jdiameter.git
----

. Building the source code
+
IMPORTANT: Maven 3.2.5 (or higher) is used to build the release.
Instructions for using Maven2, including installation, can be found at http://maven.apache.org.
+
Use Maven to build the deployable unit binary.
+
[source]
----

						[usr]$ cd -
						[usr]$ mvn install
----
+
If one expects the final build to include configuration file with both of extra features enabled, i.e.
failover and session persistence mentioned in <<_jdiameter_failover_configuration>> and
<<_jdiameter_session_persistence_configuration>> chapters accordingly, the same [app]`maven` command 
ought to be run but with the profile switch included: `-Pfailover-config-enabled`. Below are three examples
for different versions of JBoss each:
+
[source]
----

[usr]$ mvn -Pjboss4,failover-config-enabled install
[usr]$ mvn -Pjboss5,failover-config-enabled install
[usr]$ mvn -Pjboss7,failover-config-enabled install
----
+
Once the process finishes you should have the SAR built.
If the [var]`JBOSS_HOME` environment variable is set, the  will be deployed in the container after execution.


NOTE: By default {this-platform} Diameter MUX deploys in the {jee-platform} v5.x .
To change it, run [app]`maven` with the profile switch command: [parameter]`-Pjboss4`.

[[_mux_trunk_source_building]]
=== Development Trunk Source Building

Follow the <<_mux_release_source_building>> procedure, replacing the SVN source code URL with {this-trunk-source-code-url} .
