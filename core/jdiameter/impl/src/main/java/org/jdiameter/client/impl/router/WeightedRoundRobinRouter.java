  /**
   * Select peer by weighted round-robin scheduling
   * As documented in http://kb.linuxvirtualserver.org/wiki/Weighted_Round-Robin_Scheduling
   *
   * <p>
   * The weighted round-robin scheduling is designed to better handle servers
   * with different processing capacities. Each server can be assigned a weight,
   * an integer value that indicates the processing capacity. Servers with higher
   * weights receive new connections first than those with less weights, and servers
   * with higher weights get more connections than those with less weights and servers
   * with equal weights get equal connections. The pseudo code of weighted round-robin
   * scheduling is as follows:
   * <p>
   * Supposing that there is a server set S = {S0, S1, â€¦, Sn-1};
   * W(Si) indicates the weight of Si;
   * i indicates the server selected last time, and i is initialized with -1;
   * cw is the current weight in scheduling, and cw is initialized with zero;
   * max(S) is the maximum weight of all the servers in S;
   * gcd(S) is the greatest common divisor of all server weights in S;
   * <p>
   * <pre>
   * {@code
   *   while (true) {
   *     i = (i + 1) mod n;
   *     if (i == 0) {
   *       cw = cw - gcd(S);
   *       if (cw <= 0) {
   *         cw = max(S);
   *         if (cw == 0)
   *           return NULL;
   *       }
   *     }
   *     if (W(Si) >= cw)
   *       return Si;
   *   }
   * }
   * </pre>
   * <p>
   * For example, the real servers, A, B and C, have the weights, 4, 3, 2 respectively,
   * a scheduling sequence will be AABABCABC in a scheduling period (mod sum(Wi)).
   * <p>
   * In an optimized implementation of the weighted round-robin scheduling, a scheduling sequence
   * will be generated according to the server weights after the rules of IPVS are modified.
   * The network connections are directed to the different real servers based on the scheduling
   * sequence in a round-robin manner.
   * <p>
   * The weighted round-robin scheduling is better than the round-robin scheduling, when the
   * processing capacity of real servers are different. However, it may lead to dynamic load
   * imbalance among the real servers if the load of the requests vary highly. In short, there
   * is the possibility that a majority of requests requiring large responses may be directed
   * to the same real server.
   * <p>
   * Actually, the round-robin scheduling is a special instance of the weighted round-robin
   * scheduling, in which all the weights are equal.
   * <p>
   * This method is internally synchronized due to concurrent modifications to lastSelectedPeer and currentWeight.
   * Please consider this when relying on heavy throughput.
   * <p>
   * Please note: if the list of availablePeers changes between calls (e.g. if a peer becomes active or inactive),
   * the balancing algorithm is disturbed and might be distributed uneven.
   * This is likely to happen if peers are flapping.
   *
   * @param availablePeers list of peers that are in {@link PeerState#OKAY OKAY} state
   * @return the selected peer according to algorithm
